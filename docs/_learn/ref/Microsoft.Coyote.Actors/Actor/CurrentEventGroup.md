# Actor.CurrentEventGroup property

An optional operation associated with the current event being handled. An actor that handles an event can choose to complete the operation with a result object. Typically the operation will be an [`AwaitableEventGroup`](../AwaitableEventGroup-1Type) and the target actor will know what type the result is.

```csharp
public EventGroup CurrentEventGroup { get; set; }
```
