# QuiescentOperation class

This is a special operation that is completed when the Actor reaches a quiescent state, meaning the inbox cannot process any events, either it is empty or everything in it is deferred. Quiescence is never reached on a StateMachine that has a DefaultEvent handler. In that case the default event handler can be considered a quiescent notification.

```csharp
public class QuiescentOperation : AwaitableOperation<bool>
```
