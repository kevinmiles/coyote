# Operation&lt;T&gt; class

An object representing a long running operation involving one or more actors. This operation is passed along automatically during any subsequent CreateActor or SendEvent calls so that any Actor in a network of actors can complete this operation. An actor can find the operation using the CurrentOperation property. This operation contains a TaskCompletionSource that can be used to wait for the operation to be completed.

```csharp
public class Operation<T> : Operation
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The result returned when the operation is completed. |
