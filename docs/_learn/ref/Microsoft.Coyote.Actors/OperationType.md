# Operation class

An object representing a long running operation involving one or more actors. An operation can be provided as an optional argument in CreateActor and SendEvent. If a null operation is passed then the operation is inherited from the sender or target actors (based on which ever one has a [`CurrentOperation`](Actor/CurrentOperation)). In this way an operation is automatically communicated to all actors involved in completing some logical operation. Each actor involved can find the operation using their [`CurrentOperation`](Actor/CurrentOperation) property. property.

```csharp
public class Operation
```
