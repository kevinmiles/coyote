# Operation class

An object representing a long running operation involving one or more actors. This operation is passed along automatically during any subsequent CreateActor or SendEvent calls so that any Actor in a network of actors can complete this operation. An actor can find the operation using the [`CurrentOperation`](Actor/CurrentOperation) property.

```csharp
public class Operation
```
